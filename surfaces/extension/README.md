# Margin browser extension

MV3 extension for Chrome / Edge / Firefox. **Phase-4 scope** — see
[`docs/spec.md` §6.4](../../docs/spec.md#64-browser-extension):

- **Project surface (popup).** State machine driven by the active Docs
  tab: configure backend → sign in → open a Doc → "Add to Margin"
  (opens the backend-hosted Drive Picker in a new tab) → tracked view
  with role / version / comment count / last-synced / "Sync now". All
  backend calls flow through the service worker; the session token
  never touches the popup.
- **Rich UI (side panel).** Preact app — project dashboard (versions,
  derivatives, review history, reviewer participation), structured
  side-by-side version diff, comment reconciliation view.

In-canvas highlights / gutter markers / selection capture land in
Phase 6. Comment ingest is **not** an extension concern — it lives in
the backend (`.docx` export, SPEC §9.8).

## Build

[WXT](https://wxt.dev) drives the build (Vite under the hood). Scripts live
in the repo root `package.json`:

```sh
bun run ext:build              # production build, Chrome/Edge target
bun run ext:build:firefox      # production build, Firefox target
bun run ext:dev                # dev server with HMR (Chrome/Edge)
bun run ext:dev:firefox        # dev server with HMR (Firefox)
bun run ext:zip                # bundle dist/<target>/ into a publishable .zip
```

Outputs to `surfaces/extension/dist/{chrome-mv3,firefox-mv3}/`. Each
output directory is loadable directly:

- **Chrome / Edge:** `chrome://extensions` → enable Developer Mode → Load
  unpacked → pick `dist/chrome-mv3`.
- **Firefox:** `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox` → Load Temporary
  Add-on → pick any file inside `dist/firefox-mv3` (e.g. `manifest.json`).

## Configure

1. Open the extension's Options page. Enter the **Backend URL**
   (`http://localhost:8787` for local dev, or your Fly.io app URL in
   production), click **Test connection** to confirm `/healthz` responds
   (Chrome will prompt for the backend origin — approve it), then
   **Save backend URL**.

2. Click **Sign in with Google**. The Options page opens a top-level
   tab at `/api/auth/ext/launch-tab`. Better Auth runs the Google
   consent flow, lands on the `/api/auth/ext/success` bridge page, and
   the bridge hands the session token to the SW (Chromium:
   `chrome.runtime.sendMessage`; Firefox fallback: `location.hash`,
   picked up by the SW's `tabs.onUpdated` listener). The SW persists
   it under `chrome.storage.local.settings.sessionToken`; the Options
   page's `chrome.storage.onChanged` listener flips the UI to
   "Signed in" without a reload.

The popup is the primary project surface. A `<details>` diagnostics panel
at the bottom of every view shows the current `/healthz` reachability
status.

## How the popup project surface works

The popup (`entrypoints/popup/Popup.tsx`) is a Preact state machine over a
single `View` discriminated union. `boot()` drives the transitions:

1. **No settings** → options page nudge.
2. **No Doc tab** → muted "open a Google Doc."
3. Active Docs tab → SW `doc/state` (`POST /api/extension/doc-state`).
4. **Untracked** → "Add to Margin" opens `${backendUrl}/api/picker/page`
   in a new tab; the popup closes. The user picks a Doc; the page
   POSTs to `/api/picker/register-doc` via the session cookie and
   auto-closes with a "tracked" message.
5. User returns to the Docs tab and re-opens the extension → fresh
   `doc/state` call lands in the **Tracked** view (role, version label,
   comment count, last-synced, "Sync now"). "Sync now" calls SW `doc/sync`
   (`POST /api/extension/doc-sync`), which re-runs `ingestVersionComments`
   and returns refreshed state.

Every backend call routes through the SW, which adds
`Authorization: Bearer <sessionToken>` from `chrome.storage.local`. The
Picker page uses the session cookie set by Better Auth on sign-in —
same-origin with `/api/picker/register-doc`, so no bearer token leaves
the extension surface.

## Toolbar-icon routing

For Doc tabs that already belong to a project, clicking the toolbar
icon opens the **dashboard** directly instead of the popup. The SW
watches `tabs.onActivated` / `tabs.onUpdated`, calls `doc/state`
(cached briefly per `docId`), and toggles the per-tab popup:
`action.setPopup({ tabId, popup: "" })` for tracked Docs (so
`action.onClicked` fires and opens the dashboard), `popup:
"popup.html"` for everything else (non-Doc tabs, untracked Docs,
signed-out state — the popup's existing state machine handles those).
The cache is invalidated on settings change (sign-in / sign-out) and
on `doc/sync` / `doc/register` flips.

"Dashboard" resolves at click time via `utils/ui-surfaces.ts`. The
policy is conservative: the native sidebar (Chromium `chrome.sidePanel`
/ Firefox `sidebar_action`) is only used when we're confident the host
browser actually renders it. Everywhere else — Edge, Brave, Opera, Arc,
the long tail of Chromium derivatives — `openDashboard` opens a detached
popup window loading `sidepanel.html` instead. Repeat icon clicks focus
the existing popup window rather than stacking duplicates.

The native-sidebar gate is one boolean (`nativeSidebarSupported`) cached
in the SW and refreshed on every relevant storage write. evaluateAction
suppresses the per-tab popup on tracked Docs unconditionally — both the
sidebar and detached-window paths handle a direct icon-click safely, so
there's no detection-bootstrap gate to manage.

`runtime.onInstalled` opens the Options page in a new tab on first install
so users on browsers without a working `runtime.openOptionsPage()` (Arc)
can still reach setup. All "Open Options" buttons in the UI also go
through `tabs.create({ url: getURL("options.html") })` for the same
reason.

### Browser detection (`utils/browser-detect.ts`)

`detectNativeSidebarSupport()` is the source of truth:

- Firefox (UA string `Firefox/<n>`): true. The native sidebarAction works.
- Real Google Chrome (`userAgentData.brands` includes `Google Chrome`,
  with no Brave / Edge / Opera UA markers and — if a DOM is available —
  no Arc `--arc-palette-*` CSS custom properties): true.
- Everything else: false. The detached window is used.

The SW can only run the UA half of the probe (no DOM, so no Arc CSS-vars
check). Extension-page entrypoints (`entrypoints/popup/main.tsx`,
`entrypoints/options/main.ts`) call `detectAndPersistBrowserQuirks()` on
load, which runs the full probe and writes the boolean to
`chrome.storage.local.browserQuirks` — idempotent, only writes on change.
The SW's `storage.onChanged` listener picks the value up and reprimes
`cachedUseNativeSidebar`. Add new exclusion probes here if more
side-panel-less browsers come up.

The manifest declares static `host_permissions: ["https://docs.google.com/*"]`.
The extension never injects into the Docs tab — the grant is what lets
`tabs.query({url: ...})` return the active Doc's URL + title (Chrome
strips both on Doc pages otherwise). User-configured backend origins
stay on `optional_host_permissions: ["<all_urls>"]` and are requested at
sign-in time.

## Doc title

For **tracked** docs the popup / side panel use `DocState.title` from
`/api/extension/doc-state`, which is the canonical Drive name (`files.get`
result, stored on `project.name` / `version.name` at register / create
time). For **untracked** docs we have no `drive.file` grant yet, so the
popup falls back to `cleanDocTitleFallback(tab.title)` in `utils/ids.ts` —
a locale-agnostic strip that drops the trailing ` - <suffix>` only when
the suffix contains the literal word "Google" (the brand is never
localized). Pre-name-column legacy rows fall back to the same heuristic.

## Out of scope (yet)

- In-canvas highlights / gutter markers — Phase 6, requires the
  accessibility-DOM mirror or selection-event hooks ([`docs/spec.md` §9.6](../../docs/spec.md#96-canvas-rendered-doc-body)).
- Mobile / iPad Docs — browser extensions don't run on those clients.
